#### **Current Work** 🔭

I am a Researcher and PhD student at the [University of Siegen](https://www.uni-siegen.de/start/) in the [Computer Vision Group](https://www.vsa.informatik.uni-siegen.de/) headed by [Prof. Michael Möller](https://www.vsa.informatik.uni-siegen.de/en/moeller-michael) and primarily working on the [Learning2Sense](https://www.learning2sense.de/start) research project🧑‍🎓.


In this project, we are trying to better integrate the data acquisition of sensor systems with the subsequent data use. In the past, sensor systems were often developed independently of their later data use, especially not with regard to the use by machine learning methods. 
The aim of the project is to close this gap between model and sensor by, for example, incorporating the parameters of the sensor system and its physics into the optimisation of the machine learning (ML) models, or by completely changing the way we record and process data. This should allow the ML models to better adapt to the real environment, which will ideally lead to better results.

In this, my group is currently in a close collaboration with the [Chair for Computational Sensorics / Communication Engineering](https://www.cse.eti.uni-siegen.de/), working on the topic of [Fourier Ptychography](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-021-00280-y).

#### **Education** 🎓

I started my profession with a bachelor's and master's degree in computer science at the [University of Siegen](https://www.uni-siegen.de/start/)🎓, in which I already dealt with the various methods of the buzzword AI. I was able to apply the knowledge I gained there through additional jobs in industry at various companies👨‍💼. You can find more on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-philipp-schneider/) profile.

#### **Collaboration** 🤝

I am always open to scientific collaboration and like to brainstorm new ideas, preferably with a good cup of coffee☕! Just write me an [email](mailto://jan.schneider@uni-siegen.de)!

#

#### **Teaching & Student Supervision** 👨‍🏫

Within my research group, I supervise students in their coursework and theses. If you are a student and interested in my topics, just send me an [email](mailto://jan.schneider@uni-siegen.de) with a CV, transcript of records and some information about yourself. I'll be happy to chat with you a bit and together we can find a topic with which you can bring your work to a good conclusion!
